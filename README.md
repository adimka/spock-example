# spock-workshop
Spock workshop with a ready to go Maven build for Spock Tech Session

Complete the TODO's in src/test/groovy/AdventureService.groovy and src/test/groovy/AdventurerSpec.groovy to get the hang of writing and interpreting Spock specifications

The classes being tested are available in src/main/groovy/

A "mvn clean test" from the project root directory will run your Spock tests

My solutions are available in SpockWorkshopSols.g
